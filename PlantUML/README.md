# DeviceAlerting-PlantUML 
The PlantUML models in this directory capture various approaches to utilization of FHIR resources - existing and new - for the functionality of the HL7 DeviceAlerting (DEVAL) project.  Ultimately, the approach will be integrated into the FHIR specification.

NOTE:  The following approach was used to create the SVG diagrams:

1. [IntelliJ IDEA tool platform](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) with the [PlantUML Integration](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7017-plantuml-integration) plugin
2. Load and edit the .puml model file(s) 
3. Select real-time "Preview" rendering 
4. Right click in the Preview window and Save Diagram as SVG

Of course, other PlantUML tools may be used (including VS Code or command line tool) and should provide the same or similar results.
